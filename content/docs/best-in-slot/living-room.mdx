title: Best In Slot - Living Room
---

When it comes to living arrangements I've always tried to have as little of a bedroom as I need while giving as much space as possible to the living room. My thought process here being that I want to spend as much time as possible not in bed, or I'm going to just become a blob (can't trust myself not to).

## Theatre

### [TV - LG C9 OLED](https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-OLED55C9PUA-oled-4k-tv)

First purchase I made when I got a well paying job. When it comes to priorities when building up a good theatre setup I really would recommend starting with an OLED TV because it is a game changer for viewing movies and even games that take advantage of it. The smart tv software is the least awful from my experience, but like most people I'd recommend avoiding ever even setting it up unless you don't have a better alternative.

### [PlayStation 5](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps5/)

I used to be an Xbox loyalist but once introduced to PC gaming that started to change. Luckily the Xbox is migrating to just focus on PC games with Windows, and then when I want to play something that's exclusive to console I have this. Though by preference I enjoy playing games on the couch so will often opt to use this over sitting at my desk.

## Chore assistants

I'm a strong believer that when it comes to things like utilities for chores there needs to be as little friction as possible to actually use them. Especially considering my ADHD.

### [Wireless Vacuum - Dyson](https://www.dyson.com/vacuum-cleaners/cordless/v8)

A wireless vacuum has been a godsend. Now I haven't used other wireless vacuum's so I can't really compare, but the Dyson V7 that I have now has done its job.
