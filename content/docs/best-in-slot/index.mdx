title: Best In Slot
---

Because I research way too much into mundane things in my life. Despite the hyperbolic title things are still changing over time so a lot of what I own is either best at the time or best given how much I was willing/able to budget.

Also I am not an influencer, but rather a software developer with questionable spending habits. So I'm rarely going to have the newest of any one thing.
