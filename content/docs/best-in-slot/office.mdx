### [Secretlab Magnus Pro](https://secretlab.co/pages/magnus-pro/)

I've tried the [Vari standing desk](https://www.vari.com/desks-and-tables/standing-desks/) but after it broke in a move I opted to splurge for something with additional functionality.

The biggest benefit for me is the cable management which has the power cable running to the back of the desk on top through the leg. This alongside the [Secretlab PC mount](https://secretlab.co/products/premium-pc-mount) means the desk setup has no visible cables running!
