## Working Space

### [Secretlab Magnus Pro](https://secretlab.co/pages/magnus-pro/)

I've tried the [Vari standing desk](https://www.vari.com/desks-and-tables/standing-desks/) but after it broke in a move I opted to splurge for something with additional functionality. I did get a knockoff copy of the Veri desk off of Amazon and currently use it for my Gundam building.

The biggest benefit for me is the cable management which has the power cable running to the back of the desk on top through the leg. This alongside the [Secretlab PC mount](https://secretlab.co/products/premium-pc-mount) means the desk setup has no visible cables running! 

### [Logitech G560 Speakers](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/g560-rgb-gaming-speakers.980-001300/)

The speaker quality is good given the price point. The speakers volume are actually tied to the windows volume slider which has made my life a lot easier. Was getting tired of maintaining multiple volume levels.

### [Secretlab Gaming Chair](https://secretlab.co/pages/gaming-chairs)

I'm not going to say this is the best of the best with chairs, but I have tried Herman Miller as everyone recommends but they do not survive more than a couple years. This chair on the other hand can hadle my neurodivergent sitting positions.
