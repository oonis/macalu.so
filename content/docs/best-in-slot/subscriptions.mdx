title: Best In Slot - Subscriptions
description: Because owning things is no longer the norm

I am not in any way an advocate for subscriptions, but I don't always get a choice. This is especially true when it comes to anything with shared usage where I often need the user experience to be as clean and easy as possible.

## Password manager - 1Password

Have it setup with my family and sharing passwords between each other is seamless and it works well holding my cards, passwords, and notes. Bitwarden is something I had considered at the time but the usability didn't seem right for introducing to my parents.

Proton pass is something I've been playing around with on the side for my own use, and despite not supporting as many types (notably missing attachments as of writing this), it's big selling point for me is setting up unique emails for your logins. This is a lot stronger a security measure than just add a plus sign and some identifier for each login.
